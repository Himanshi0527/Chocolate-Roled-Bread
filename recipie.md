3. take one peice of bread and layer it with fresh cream and add one more layer of chopped dry fruits to it. 
4. Take another peice and put it over the previous peice.
5. Now cover this peice entirely with melted chocolate and add rainbow sprinkles over it so that it looks very beautiful.
6.  Repeat the same with all the peices.
